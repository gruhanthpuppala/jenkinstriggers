Poll SCM:

This is similar to github webhook, here the jenkins server is keep on checking our git repo are there any changes (commit/push) or not. Jenkins to check every minute we need to set cron job on jenkins server

in build trigger select poll scm and mention `* * * * *` to check every min, if there is any chnges it triggers the pipeline
